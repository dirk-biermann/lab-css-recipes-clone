      Apple Pies
      This was my grandmother's apple pie recipe. I have never seen another one
      quite like it. It will always be my favorite and has won me several first place
      prizes in local competitions. I hope it becomes one of your favorites as well!

      1/2 cup unsalted butter
      3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
      1/4 cup water
      3 tablespoons all-purpose flour
      1/4 cup water
      1/2 cup white sugar
      1/2 cup packed brown sugar
      8 Granny Smith apples - peeled, cored and sliced
